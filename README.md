# About the project
This project evaluates two other models on the generated dataset, [GLAN](https://github.com/chunyuanY/RumorDetection) and [PPA](https://github.com/zperfet/PathFakeGit) respectively. The dataset is generated from [evasive metadata generation](https://github.com/Gansemeran/geng551X) and [PLAN](https://github.com/serenaklm/rumor_detection) is selected as our based model for generation. Conda environment is suggested for running all models.
